#CPlusPlus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
In this project I created a program for Corner Grocer that outputs a menu of options to a user, then receives input for a menu option and performs the selected action. This program opens and reads a text file containing each item purchased from Corner Grocer in a given day,
and creates a new text file named frequency.dat, this file contains the frequency of each item on the original text file. The program can also output this data as a histogram, and allows the user to search a particular item from the list, outputting that item's purchase frequency.
This project allowed Corner Grocer to input their sales reports for each day and output the frequency at which each item was purchased.

#What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I felt that I succeeded in being able to create a program that uses multiple languages. This was my first project in which I was tasked with using multiple programming languages. My C++ file read and perfromed python functions to perform the required tasks 
for Corner Grocer. I also used functions to minimize the amount of code in my main function.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could've improved my code by using classes and following a more object oriented programming strategy to make the code more efficient and secure. Using classes would've created private fields for data, making the program more secure. I could've also called methods to simplify my main function.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I felt that the part I struggled with the most was working with the text files to output my frequency.dat file. I only recently began working with text files in C++ and python so I found this part to be a bit challenging. I used class resources to become more familiar with opening and closing text files,
and how to use the data from these files.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill I learned that will be most helpful in future projects is working with multiple programming languages. C++ and python are both powerful languages when used alone, using them together is a powerful tool to write efficient, readable code.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used both pyhton and C++ to create and call functions within my main function. By using these, my functions are clear and easy to modify in the future. Another strategy to make this program more maintainable, readable, and adaptable was using in-line comments to explain 
what each part of my code did. These strategies I imposed helped to make this code more readable and adaptable in the future.
